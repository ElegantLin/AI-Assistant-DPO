To integrate the `trl` (v0.9.6 tag) and `LLaMA-Factory` (main branch) repositories into your own private repository using `git subtree`, follow this structured approach. This method preserves each project's full history, allows tracking your modifications, and enables pulling updates from the original repositories (especially useful for `LLaMA-Factory`'s main branch).

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. **Initialize Your New Repository**
   ```bash
   mkdir my-private-repo
   cd my-private-repo
   git init
   git commit --allow-empty -m "Initial commit"  # Create first commit for subtree adds
   ```

#### 2. **Add Original Repositories as Remotes**
   Add the original repositories as remotes to fetch their histories:
   ```bash
   git remote add trl https://github.com/huggingface/trl.git
   git remote add llama-factory https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory.git
   git fetch --all  # Fetch all branches and tags from both remotes
   ```

#### 3. **Add `trl` as a Subtree**
   Add the `trl` repository at the specific tag (`v0.9.6`) into a `trl/` subdirectory:
   ```bash
   git subtree add --prefix=trl/ trl v0.9.6 --squash
   ```
   - `--prefix=trl/`: Sets the target directory.
   - `--squash`: Combines the entire history of `trl` into a single commit. Omit this if you want full history, but it simplifies the initial import.

#### 4. **Add `LLaMA-Factory` as a Subtree**
   Add the `LLaMA-Factory` main branch into a `LLaMA-Factory/` subdirectory:
   ```bash
   git subtree add --prefix=LLaMA-Factory/ llama-factory main --squash
   ```

#### 5. **Push to Your Private Repository**
   Add your GitHub repository as a remote and push:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-private-repo.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

#### 6. **Track Your Modifications**
   - Make changes directly in the `trl/` or `LLaMA-Factory/` subdirectories.
   - Commit changes normally: Git treats these as part of your repository.
   - To highlight changes against the original, use:
     ```bash
     git diff HEAD~1 HEAD -- trl/  # Compare last commit for trl/
     ```

#### 7. **Pull Updates from Original Repositories**
   To update `LLaMA-Factory` with changes from its main branch:
   ```bash
   git fetch llama-factory main
   git subtree pull --prefix=LLaMA-Factory/ llama-factory main --squash
   ```
   - Resolve any merge conflicts if your modifications overlap with upstream changes.

   For `trl`, if needed:
   ```bash
   git subtree pull --prefix=trl/ trl v0.9.6 --squash
   ```

#### 8. **Create Feature Branches for Collaboration**
   Create branches to isolate changes per subproject:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b trl-modifications
   # Modify files in trl/ and commit
   git checkout -b llama-factory-modifications
   # Modify files in LLaMA-Factory/ and commit
   ```
   Collaborators can check out these branches to review changes against the original subtree commits.

### Key Explanation
- **Why `git subtree`?** It allows embedding separate repositories as subdirectories while preserving history. Unlike `git submodule`, it doesn’t require extra metadata files, and collaborators can work without learning a new workflow .
- **Squash vs. Full History**: Using `--squash` simplifies the initial import by combining all history into one commit. If you prefer full history, omit `--squash`, but be aware this may make your history larger.
- **Directory Structure**: Your repository will look like:
  ```
  my-private-repo/
  ├── trl/
  │   └── ... (files from trl v0.9.6)
  ├── LLaMA-Factory/
  │   └── ... (files from LLaMA-Factory main branch)
  └── (your own files)
  ```
- **Tracking Updates**: Subtrees allow pulling in updates from the original repositories. This is crucial for `LLaMA-Factory`, which actively evolves .
- **Collaboration**: Branches like `trl-modifications` let collaborators see changes specific to each subproject. Use `git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all` to visualize history.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Clean Working Tree**: Ensure no uncommitted changes before running `git subtree add` or `pull` .
- **Conflict Resolution**: If `git subtree pull` causes conflicts, resolve them as in a normal merge, then commit.
- **History Inspection**: Use `git log --oneline --prefix=trl/` to see changes in the `trl/` directory.

|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Add trl as subtree                       | `git subtree add --prefix=trl/ trl v0.9.6 --squash`                        |
| Add LLaMA-Factory as subtree             | `git subtree add --prefix=LLaMA-Factory/ llama-factory main --squash`       |
| Update LLaMA-Factory from upstream       | `git subtree pull --prefix=LLaMA-Factory/ llama-factory main --squash`      |
| Create branch for trl modifications      | `git checkout -b trl-modifications`                                         |

This setup efficiently combines both projects, maintains their histories, and facilitates collaboration and updates. For more advanced use, like contributing changes back to the original projects, consider `git subtree push` .
